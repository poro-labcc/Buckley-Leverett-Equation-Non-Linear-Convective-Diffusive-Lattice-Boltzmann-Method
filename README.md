# Buckley-Leverett-Equation-Non-Linear-Convective-Diffusive-Lattice-Boltzmann-Method

The C++ codes presented in this repository correspond to implementations designed to model convective, convective–diffusive, and convective–diffusive systems with dynamic capillary pressure within the Lattice Boltzmann framework.

The analyses performed with these codes are described in the publication: “Lattice Boltzmann method assessment for the Buckley–Leverett equation: Extension to dynamic capillary effect” (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0264878).
